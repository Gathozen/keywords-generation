# keywords-generation
Automatically generating keywords for Google Ads using Python.

This is a Python project from DataCamp, showing how Python can be used to automatically generate keywords for Google Ads marketing campaigns. In this project, the task is to create a set of keyword and product combinations which can be used by a large furniture retailer in their ads.

The Python code involves creating lists of products and specific marketing words, saving the data in a Pandas DataFrame, and using a nested loop function to  create every possible combination of words from both lists.

The output is a CSV file ready to be used by the marketing department.

Overall, it is a very good learning experience that I recommend to any Python beginner. I wrote a detailed article about muy experience writing this. You can check it out on my Medium:
